# Theory of Algorithms project 

Implement the MD5 message-digest algorithm 

## Getting Started
This repo contains the MD5 message-digest algorithm fully implemented in the C language

### Prerequisites

You will need the following: </br>

1. A C compiler installed on your machine to run the code.</br>
2. An intermediate level knowlege of C.</br>
3. An understanding of how and why the MD5 message-digest algorithm works. </br>


For MacOs and other unix operating systems. My system is MacOS so this is what I used 
```
gcc --version 
```

### Installing
Just clone this repository using git or else download the zip file.

```
git clone https://github.com/ross39/Theory-of-algorithms-project
```
