### MD5 HASH ALOGRITHM
Hi and welcome to my project for the module theory of algorithms. The goal of the project is to code the MD5 message-digest algorithm. MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321

## Motivation
Well needless to say that a lot of the motivation for the project stems from the fact the project is part of my college coursework:grin:. But on a more serious note the is topic of cryptography and cryptographic hash functions in particular is really facinating to me. In many ways they underpin society as they are what allow function on the internet to exist such as secure transactions, banking, communications etc to exist. If we didn't have any way to implemement safe security on the internet then there wouldn't be much point to it. I also have a deep appreciation for the blend of computer science and mathematics involved.

## Build status
The final update is working perfectly on my system. MacOs



## Code style

 
## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
C. This entire project is written in the C programming language.
## Features
Ability to select between hashing single strings or large files. Also really fast. 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project.
